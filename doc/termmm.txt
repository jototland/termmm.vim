CONFIGURATION

                                                               *g:termmm_config*
g:termmm_config

This configuration variable allows you to store configuration for certain named
termmms. Is is a dictionary (by name), each value being a dictionary
with configuration settings for the termmmof that name.

Example configuration: >
    let g:termmm_config = get(g:, 'termmm_config', {})
    let g:termmm_config['python'] = {'cmd':'python3', 'nofocus':1}
    let g:termmm_config['R'] = {'cmd':'R --vanilla --quiet', 'nofocus':1}
<
The 'cmd' key stores the command to be run whenever you start that terminal.

If the 'nofocus' key is true, the termmm will not automatically get focus,
when it is visible.

                                                            *g:termmm_splittype*
